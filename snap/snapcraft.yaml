    # FIXME: This will create currently a symlink inside /snap/bin
    # which points nowhere as the service isn't exposed as application
    # for the user. Instead snapd needs to gain support to handle
    # aliases for services differently by adding the Alias= option
    # within the systemd unit file instead for example. Until this
    # is implemented we keep the alias disabled.
