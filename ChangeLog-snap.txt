  * This is manual merge of the NM 1.2 snap changes re-based on top
    of NM 1.10. It's also the first release of the snap from this git
    repository (vs. the network-manager snappy-hwe-team git repo).
    This branch was created from the bionic distro branch, and uses
    the distro patches, a snap support patch, and direct commits for
    snap packaging changes.
