  * Add missing bits to enable sharing connections and be able to access points. Fixes LP: #1832494.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/network-manager/+git/network-manager/+merge/369325
  * snap: remove debug info
    
    Remove debug info, which was inadvertingly introduced in a previous
    commit. This reduces the snap size in two thirds.
    Merge-Proposal: https://code.launchpad.net/~alfonsosanchezbeato/network-manager/+git/network-manager/+merge/370807
  * snap: remove kernel-module-control interface
    
    The firewall-control interface already provides a kmod plug that makes
    sure the modules needed by ip tables are pre-loaded on boot.

  * snap: copy changelog to package

  * This is manual merge of the NM 1.2 snap changes re-based on top
    of NM 1.10. It's also the first release of the snap from this git
    repository (vs. the network-manager snappy-hwe-team git repo).
    This branch was created from the bionic distro branch, and uses
    the distro patches, a snap support patch, and direct commits for
    snap packaging changes.
