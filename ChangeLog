  * Flush IPs of devices we are taking control of in the wrapper, after
    calling netplan apply and before starting NetworkManager. netplan
    leaves IPs configured by networkd around and that confuses
    NetworkManager. This is a workaround until LP:#1870561 is fixed. As
    we are using the 'ip' command for this, we need to add network-observe
    to the list of interfaces we want.

  * Remove patches from the debian folder
    We take them from snap-patch now.
    
    Add phony part to stage compiled packages
    
    Remove version-script
    version-script is now deprecated.
    
    Add patches specific to the NM snap to snap-patch
    
    Follow applied branches from auto-import repos
    
    tests: run iptables from core snap now
    
    Set rc-manager=symlink for UC18 and later
    Otherwise, NM will call resolvconf even though it fails if UC version is
    newer than 16. To properly set DNS we need to set both dns and
    rc-manager options, but we were doing this only for the former. However,
    this did not have adverse effects as, as said, the call to resolvconf
    failed, while systemd-resolved was properly updated.
    
    Do not call dhcp-lease-mover anymore
    As it was not actually working anymore since we were not staging inotify
    anymore since a while.
    
    Specify explicitly copyrights to include
    Previously there were copyright files included from non-staged
    packages.
    
    Add unstage.txt file
    This file contains a list of debian package that we are not actually
    staging, although snapcraft adds them to manifest.yaml. CI now
    recognizes this file, and manually removes the listed packages from the
    manifest when releasing a snap to the store.
    
    Do not stage iptables/xtables
    iptables and all needed libraries are now included in the core18 snap,
    since revision 1049 (2019-06-27).
    
    Do not stage libs already in core18
    The libraries were not really included finally in the snap, but they
    were triggering CVE warnings from the review tools that did not actually
    apply.
    
    snap: call netplan apply using DBus
    Use DBus netplan interface to re-start network services after setting
    NetworkManager as the default renderer.
    
    snap: add network-setup-control interface
    Add network-setup-control interface so we can call 'netplan apply' from
    the snap.

  * Unstage some packages from networkmananger-phony
    The networkmananger-phony part was staging as dependencies packages that
    we were not actually including in the snap. Add to the list of packages
    to unstage on release.
